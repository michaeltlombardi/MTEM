{"name":"MTEM","tagline":"Management Tooling Excellence Matrix","body":"#MTEM: Management Tooling Excellence Matrix\r\n\r\n##Purpose\r\nWhen deciding what software goes into your datacenter the ability to manage that product programmatically is important -  especially when the product will be deployed in large numbers or with complex configurations. \r\n\r\nIn the Windows world, this means the product must be manageable via PowerShell.  This matrix is meant to be a combination of an at-a-glance resource for determining how well a given product supports programmatic management and a score card for developers of those products to target for improved usability.\r\n\r\n##Description\r\nThe matrix is a reference for anyone who needs to administer Windows Servers and is curious about the level of support a given vendor provides for programmatic management. The matrix scores each specific product offering of a vendor separately, as applications do not always have parity of support from a vendor. \r\n\r\nThe matrix scores the software on API, PowerShell Module, and Desired State Configuration based on the [rubrics](#rubrics) on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 indicates non-existant and 100 represents best-in-class. \r\n\r\nThis matrix cannot be made accurate and relevent without community input. Please see the [contributing](#contributing) section for more information.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This matrix is always subject to revisions. The matrix is organized alphabetically, first by vendor, then by product.\r\n\r\n###Matrix\r\n| Vendor         | Product               | API | PS  | DSC | As Of      |\r\n|:---------------|:----------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----------:|\r\n| A10 Networks   | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Adobe          | Echosign              |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Amazon         | AWS                   |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Chef           | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Citrix         | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Cisco          | UCS                   |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| CloudBerry     | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| DataCore       | SANsymphony-V         |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Dell           | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| DH2i           | DxEnterprise          |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| ElasticBox     | ElasticBox            |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| EMC            | XtremIO               |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| F5             | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| GlobalScape    | EFT                   | 71  |  0  |  -  | 2015-12-09 |\r\n| HP             | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| ITRS Group     | GeneOS                |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Jenkins        | Jenkins               |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| LogRhythm      | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Microsoft      | Windows Server 2008R2 |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Microsoft      | Windows Server 2012R2 |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Microsoft      | Windows Server 2016   |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Nimble Storage | Nimble OS             |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Octopus Deploy | Octopus Deploy        |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Okta           | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Puppet         | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Pure Storage   | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Service Now    | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Slack          | Slack                 |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| SolarWinds     | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Splunk         | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| StorMagic      | vSAN                  |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Symantec       | BackUp Exec           |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| Veeam          | -                     |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| VMWare         | VSphere 5.5           |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| VMWare         | ESXi 5.5              |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n| WinSCP         | WinSCP                |  -  |  -  |  -  |      -     |\r\n\r\n\r\n###Rubrics\r\nThere is a separate rubric for each category.
